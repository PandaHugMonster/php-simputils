# Unstable Versions Installation

**Important**: DO NOT USE THESE VERSIONS, IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHAT THEY DOES.

## `dev-main` Less unstable version

From this point, I decided to have "stable" version with some recent updates that I need
before the final release. Consider it "ALPHA" release.

**Though, avoid using it on production, it would be times better if you would
just poke me with a ticket, so I would release the stable version quicker!**

Just keep in mind, even though it should be "stable", it's still "unreleased" and 
might have unfinished concepts. Please avoid using it without serious reasons.


```shell
composer require spaf/simputils "dev-main"
```

## `dev-dev` Very unstable version

Additionally, I've decided to have unstable version with much more recent updates that
I need in a first row with unfinished and broken concepts.

Just keep in mind, it can completely break your code, unfinished concepts or
even broken code could be here a very common thing.

I strongly recommend to avoid using this code, except cases
when you are very totally sure what you are doing!

**Important**: DO NOT USE THIS VERSION!

```shell
composer require spaf/simputils "dev-dev"
```
